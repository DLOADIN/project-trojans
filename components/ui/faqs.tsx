      question: "How does your road safety system work?",
      answer:
        "Our system uses AI-powered cameras and sensors installed at key locations to monitor traffic conditions and detect potential hazards in real-time. When a dangerous situation is detected, the system automatically sends alerts to relevant parties including drivers, pedestrians, and emergency services.",

      question: "Which areas in Rwanda are currently covered?",
      answer:
        "We're currently focusing on major urban areas including Kigali, Butare, and Gisenyi, with plans to expand to other cities and major highways across Rwanda in the coming months.",
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the accident prediction system?",
      answer:
        "Our system has demonstrated over 92% accuracy in predicting potential accident scenarios based on real-time traffic patterns, weather conditions, and historical data. The AI continuously learns and improves its prediction capabilities over time.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I receive alerts on my mobile phone?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we offer a mobile application that provides real-time alerts based on your location. The app is available for both Android and iOS devices and can be configured to provide different types of safety notifications.",
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly are emergency services notified?",
      answer:
        "Our system notifies emergency services within seconds of detecting a critical situation. The average response time from detection to notification is under 30 seconds, significantly reducing emergency response times.",
